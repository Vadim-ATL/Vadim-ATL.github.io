## Research

My research focuses on **controllable generation for medical imaging**, specifically latent diffusion models conditioned on clinical attributes (text prompts, anatomical coordinates, segmentation masks). This addresses critical data scarcity problems in medical AI.

**Current interests:** Multi-modal conditioning in diffusion models, downstream task validation, semantic alignment in latent space, and synthetic data generation for rare pathologies.

## Publications & Preprints

**Latent-Aligned Diffusion for Controllable Chest X-ray Synthesis** *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (CMIG), 2025 — Under Review* We propose a latent diffusion model with semantic alignment mechanisms for generating chest X-rays.
